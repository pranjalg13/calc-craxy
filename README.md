Numblet is a fun and challenging math puzzle game designed for Reddit webview! Players are tasked with forming a target number using six given numbers and basic mathematical operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`). Each number can be used only once, and players have three attempts to crack the puzzle.  

If youâ€™re stuck, you can give up to reveal the solutionâ€”but be warned: once you finish (whether you win, lose, or give up), you canâ€™t replay the same game again.
